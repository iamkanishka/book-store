The Core Idea: Apps vs. Libraries in Nx
In an Nx workspace, the distinction between apps and libs is crucial:

apps: These are the final, deployable units of your project. They are the entry points for your users. An app should contain as little code as possible, primarily responsible for configuration, routing, and assembling the building blocks provided by libraries.

libs: These are the building blocks of your application. They contain the vast majority of your code: components, services, state management, UI elements, business logic, and data access. Libraries are meant to be composed together to create applications.

You absolutely can put all your code in the app folder, but doing so negates the architectural benefits of Nx. Here’s why using libraries is the superior strategy.

Key Advantages of Using Nx Libraries
1. Enforced Architecture & Clear Boundaries
Nx analyzes the dependencies between libraries to build a project graph. This isn't just a visual gimmick; it's a powerful tool for enforcing architectural rules.

Dependency Rules: You can set rules in your ESLint configuration (.eslintrc.json) to control which libraries can depend on others. For example, you can enforce that a "feature" library can depend on a "UI" library, but the "UI" library cannot depend on the "feature" library.

Preventing "Spaghetti Code": This prevents your application from becoming a tangled mess where every part is tightly coupled to every other part. It forces a clear, layered architecture, making the codebase easier to understand and maintain.

Without Libraries: All code lives in one place, and any file can import any other file. There are no enforced boundaries, making it very easy to create a tightly-coupled, unmaintainable monolith.

2. Faster Build and Test Times (The "Affected" Commands)
This is arguably the most significant performance benefit of Nx. Because Nx understands the dependency graph, it can identify exactly what code was impacted by a change.

nx affected:build / nx affected:test: When you make a change inside a library, Nx knows which other libraries and applications depend on it. When you run an "affected" command, Nx will only build or test the libraries that were actually changed or those that depend on the changes.

CI/CD Efficiency: On a large project, this can reduce CI/CD times from hours to minutes. Instead of rebuilding and re-testing the entire application on every commit, you only touch what's necessary.

Without Libraries: A change anywhere in the app requires you to rebuild and re-test the entire application every single time. This does not scale.

3. Code Sharing and Reusability
Libraries are the primary mechanism for sharing code in a monorepo.

Between Apps: Imagine you have a web app and an admin dashboard. Common elements like UI components, authentication services, or data models can be placed in libraries and used by both applications without duplicating code.

With Storybook: You can create a library of UI components and serve it with Storybook. This allows you to develop, test, and document your UI in complete isolation from any specific application logic.

Without Libraries: Sharing code between apps becomes a manual copy-and-paste exercise, which is error-prone and leads to code getting out of sync.

4. Improved Scalability and Organization
As your application grows, a single app folder becomes chaotic and difficult to navigate. Libraries provide a clear structure for organizing your code by domain or function.

Logical Grouping: You can structure your libs folder by domain, creating a clear and scalable project structure. For example:

libs/products/feature-search

libs/products/data-access

libs/orders/feature-checkout

libs/shared/ui-kit

libs/shared/auth

Ownership: This structure makes it easier for teams to own specific parts of the codebase. The "Products" team can work within libs/products without creating conflicts for the "Orders" team working in libs/orders.

Without Libraries: You end up with a massive src/app folder with dozens or hundreds of folders, with no clear indication of their purpose or relationship to each other.

A Simple Comparison
Aspect

Without Libraries (All in app)

With Libraries (Structured)

Architecture

Unstructured, no enforced boundaries. Any file can import any other.

Layered and explicit. Dependency rules prevent invalid imports.

Performance

Slow. Every change requires a full rebuild and re-test of the entire app.

Fast. Nx's "affected" commands only build/test what changed.

Code Sharing

Difficult and manual. Requires copy-pasting between projects.

Easy and automatic. Shared code lives in a library, imported everywhere.

Scalability

Poor. A large app folder becomes a "big ball of mud," hard to navigate.

Excellent. Code is organized by domain, making it easy to find and manage.

Collaboration

High risk of conflicts. Developers can easily impact unrelated features.

Low risk of conflicts. Teams can work on isolated libraries concurrently.

Conclusion
While you can technically avoid libraries, you would be choosing to discard the most powerful features that Nx offers. Nx libraries are not just folders; they are the fundamental building blocks that enable code sharing, enforced architectural boundaries, and intelligent, high-performance tooling.

For any project that you expect to grow beyond a small prototype, adopting a library-based architecture from the start will save you enormous amounts of time and prevent significant technical debt in the long run.
